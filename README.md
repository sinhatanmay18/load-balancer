▪ Implemented a Request Mapping engine tailored for load balancing scenarios using Spring Boot and MySQL.

▪ Utilized consistent hashing with the SHA-256 algorithm for precise request distribution, focusing on specific
parameters: IP and port for server mapping and username plus email for user request mapping, ensuring
balanced and targeted traffic allocation.

▪ Designed and exposed APIs to dynamically add and remove servers on demand, making the Request Mapping
Engine highly adaptable to changing requirements.
